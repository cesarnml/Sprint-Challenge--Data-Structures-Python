Add your answers to the questions below.

1. What is the runtime complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` method?
O(n) due to requirement to traverse each node
2. What is the space complexity of your `depth_first_for_each` function?
O(n) due to stack
3. What is the runtime complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?

4. What is the space complexity of your `breadth_first_for_each` method?


5. What is the runtime complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(n^2) due to nested for loop
6. What is the space complexity of the provided code in `names.py`?
O(1) since list elements can be accessed in constant time
7. What is the runtime complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(1) due to outer for loop since dict values can be accessed in constant time
8. What is the space complexity of your optimized code in `names.py`?
O(n) since I had to create a dictionary out of names_2
